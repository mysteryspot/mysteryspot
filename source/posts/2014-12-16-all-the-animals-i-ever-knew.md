The first animal I ever knew was a nice German Shepherd mix named Venus. She liked to eat the tether ball. I was too young to know her well, but her name was one of the first words I ever learned and so later, when I learned about art in high school, I struggled with a sense that there was something canine about Botticelli's *Birth of Venus*. I don't know the story of how or when Venus died.

Then came Sugar. Sugar! The first animal I loved. Porky little mutt who washed up onto the back porch one day, five-by-ten slab of concrete, rusted barbecue grill, twenty-five pound dog. We moved a lot, and Sugar moved with us. Dad was looking for work, Mom was fighting a losing battle with a brain tumor, and my sister and I cried and complained. We moved our things from the spare bedrooms of Dad's people in Michigan to the spare bedrooms of Mom's people in Florida, back and forth. Four of us crammed into the cab of a tiny pickup truck, dog riding in the back, up and down the country. Sugar was anxious – not one to chill and ride along with her nose in the breeze – and every time we stopped moving she jumped out of the truck only to be caught up at the neck by the rope that tied her in, tongue sticking out and eyes bulging, and dad would have to throw it into park and rush to lift her up so she wouldn't strangle herself.

Sugar was an inside dog. She was housebroken, went outside to do her business, but otherwise mostly stayed in the living room. That was before we made our final trip to Florida, and before the Stepmother came along.

The Stepmother wasn't keen on inside dogs and so Sugar was moved into the garage. There was a hole cut in the cinderblock wall that she could squeeze through to go outside – this was rural Florida, where dogs roamed as they pleased – and it was my job to lock her into the garage each night by sliding a piece of plywood over the hole. I hated locking her in, though; it was hot in there in the summer, and I didn't see why, if she was allowed to run all over during the day, she couldn't do the same at night, so most nights I pretended to forget to put the board over the hole.

I came home from school one day and the stepmother said, "Where's Sugar?" Just like that. "Where's Sugar?" I could tell by her voice that something was up, but the stepmother had a way of discouraging questions which was to hit the sides of our heads with the heel of her palm hard enough to lift us off our feet. I ran outside and spent an hour running all over the neighborhood calling Sugar's name, and when I finally came home the Stepmother said, "Your Dad ran her over last night. Did you put the board over the hole?"

It was true: She had run out into the road in the dark just as Dad was turning into the driveway and had fallen under the tire of his truck. I hated thinking of it from either point of view: Sugar must have been in such pain, and Dad must have been thinking, what now, what now. What else could possibly go wrong? He had taken her to the vet during the night and he was still there with her in the morning when I had woken up, put food into her bowl, and walked to the bus stop without knowing anything about it. Her injuries were severe but she lived for another week before we finally put her down. Looking back I think it was cruel of us to have held out for so long.

The Stepmother had a thing for ducks. Duck place mats, duck pictures on the wall, duck figurines, a duck doormat, a sign on the wall that said "home sweet home" with a duck on it. And then, from where I don't know, a real little duckling. We named him "Ducky" and then put him out into the yard where he lasted a few weeks before he was killed by one of the neighbor's cats.

The stepmother was distraught. She sobbed, "He was such a good duck!" She said, "Someone has to teach those cats a lesson." She said, "Everybody get in the car!" and we all drove down to the Humane Society to pick out a kick-ass, cat-eating dog that we were going to set loose on the neighborhood, and that's how we came to meet Casey.

Casey was a fat, lazy golden retriever who turned out not to be the type of dog who ate cats but she ate everything else she could get her mouth on. She ate stale bread, rotten fish, lizards and toads, cat poop. She ate dog food and milk bones. She ate dry spaghetti.

She had the same deal as Sugar: wandered the neighborhood by day, slept in the garage at night, and this time I remembered to put the board over the hole. A year went by, and she had a litter of puppies. A year after that, another litter of puppies. We drove to the flea market and put up a big cardboard sign that said "Free Golden Pups."

Casey sometimes wandered up the road and brought home baby chickens or ducks in her mouth. She didn't hurt them, only brought them home and dropped them in the yard where they would run around and imprint on her as if she was their mother.

One day she brought home an unusual looking bird and Dad said, "It's a baby quail!" He took an interest. He took it inside to feed it, and decided to keep it until it was old enough to fend for itself. He named it Dan, because Dan Quail.

He kept it in a shoe box beside him while he watched TV, but it turns out that a much better way to keep baby quails warm is for your Dad to sort of tuck them into the space in the easy chair right behind his butt. Also, it makes the baby quail happy. He sat on it like that every night for weeks.

And then it grew up, and it turned out that the whole time it wasn't even a quail at all but instead was just a funny looking chicken. By then they were best friends, and every night the chicken stood on the back of the sofa and watched TV with dad.

It couldn't last forever. The stepmother had some very particular ideas about what the house should look like: more ducks, fewer chickens, and so Dad found a guy with a farm who agreed to take this chicken into his coop. Dan Quail, the chicken, possibly the only animal who ever really went to live on a farm in his old age.

I went to college. I came home for Thanksgiving, I came home for Christmas. Each visit Casey was a little fatter, a little grayer. She still wandered the neighborhood, still went for years at a time without a bath.

I dropped out of college and went home to work in construction. By then our family, such as it was, had split up, all of us living in different houses all over town, and Casey was sent from house to house, a piece of luggage that nobody wanted to claim, and when I finally got myself together and headed back to school I took her with me. We moved into an apartment that didn't allow dogs. I thought: who could object to a fat, lazy, golden retriever? Just after I signed the lease, with the pen still in my hand, I told them, "Ah, there's something else I forgot to tell you. I have a dog?"

I thought they would say, "Oh, well, you're on the lease now, nothing to be done about it." I thought they would laugh. I thought that once I signed the lease, I was in. Instead, they became very stern and told me I had to get rid of the dog or be evicted immediately. If it can be said that I ever became an adult at all, it happened then, when I chose to be evicted.

I went to an animal shelter when I was in college and the animal shelter said, sorry, we don't allow college students to adopt animals. You are too irresponsible! Just then another guy came into the shelter carrying a cardboard box and said, I have a kitten here that won't stop going up to my dog and she's going to get herself eaten. The animal shelter said, sorry, we don’t take animals off the street. There’s a process. I said, I'll take her! The woman at the shelter said, wait, wait! But it was too late, I ran away with the cat in the box.

And so we ended up with a Siamese cat. I installed a cat door so she could come and go, and when she got big enough she went around the neighborhood killing everything she could find and dragging it into the apartment through the cat door. She killed frogs, lizards, birds, rats and mice, snakes, moles. She killed a full-sized rabbit that was bigger than she was, left a trail of blood from the cat door across the floor of the living room that stopped at the body.

A few years later she followed me to the bus stop – or at least that is the theory since she always tried to follow me to the bus stop – and then she disappeared. She went missing for a whole day, and then a couple of days, and then a week, and then a couple of weeks. We posted fliers and stuffed mailboxes with a sad little picture of the cat, but nothing. We put an ad in the newspaper and for a week it was the same deal – no response – but then we got a call from a guy who said, "I think I have your cat."

He said he and his wife had driven down from Canada in their RV to visit their friends who lived in the area, and on their trip back to Canada they heard a strange noise coming from the back of the caravan. There she was in one of the cabinets, her leg broken but otherwise okay, hissing, hungry, angry. They took her to the vet, had her leg fixed, and checked the Seattle papers to see if anyone had lost a cat, which is when they found our ad.

There were problems: his wife had really taken to the cat, and they were thinking of keeping her. Also, they were out six hundred bucks for the vet bill. No problem! We could solve that! We had a credit card with no balance. We had to move quickly because the Canadian man was at the airport about to board a plane, but we came up with a plan: Instead of taking the cat back to Canada, he would load her onto the plane and send her back to us in a cat carrier, and we would send him six hundred dollars for the vet bill plus another hundred and fifty to cover shipping costs. He was doing us a big, big favor by prying the cat out of his wife's arms for us.

We were so grateful. To the airport! She had been missing for almost a month by this time, and we had all but given her up for lost, so it was a thrill to imagine her panicked face peeking out through the door of the carrier. She would be so scared! This was early 2001, before the Patriot Act, so we were able to go right up to the gate to wait for her. The plane pulled up and unloaded, and people streamed out into the gate, and then there were no more people. We asked the gate attendant if we were in the right place; yes, this was the flight we were waiting for. No, she didn't know about any animals in the cargo hold, but she would check.

When I think back on it I can't help seeing it in the same way that you are seeing it right now, which is to say: look at this idiot getting taken by this c-grade con-artist. All I can say for myself is that there was a time when I couldn't imagine someone being so horrible in such a calculating way; I couldn't imagine someone waking up in the morning and making a *plan* to be so intentionally horrible.

To the animals of my friends and family, to Jodi, Huggy Bear, Mimi, Petey, Charley, Tipsy, Jaque, Klink, Grady, Rambo, Bonnie, Randy, Katie Bell, Patton, Ginger, Oliver, Olson, Melita, Freak, Mazzy, Monkey, Nick, Betty, Frank. Winnie, Capitol Hill's big black dog with a heart three sizes too big. Milkshake, the dog three sizes too small. Weezy, Jackson, Higgins, Roo, Nigel, Nick's cat, Megan's cat: Good dogs! Good kitties!

- Jerry's cat's name?

To the bird I shot with a pellet gun when I was ten, the cat who crawled up into the engine of the fuel truck where I worked at the airport in Gainesville, the turtle I ran over in Starke, the mouse in the glue trap and the mostly-dead squirrel both of whom I tried to kill quickly, and to the rabbit whose neck I broke to butcher and eat when I was twelve, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!
